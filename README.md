# PRODIGY_SD_01 Temperature Converter

This is a Python application that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for converting temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. The program uses the Tkinter library to create an interactive window where users can input a temperature in one unit and get the equivalent temperature in the other two units.

## Features

- **Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit and Kelvin**
- **Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius and Kelvin**
- **Convert Kelvin to Celsius and Fahrenheit**
- **Clear and reset fields**

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (This is included with most Python installations)

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or download the script.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
4. Run the script using the following command:
   ```bash
   python temp_su.py
   ```
5. The temperature converter window will open, allowing you to perform conversions.

## Usage

1. **Input a value** in the Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin field.
2. **Click the "Convert" button** to calculate and display the equivalent temperatures in the other two units.
3. **Click the "Clear" button** to reset all fields.

## Example

If you input `100` in the Celsius field and click "Convert", the program will display `212.00` in the Fahrenheit field and `373.15` in the Kelvin field.
